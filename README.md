Fras.m has the 6 ode for Ras signaling pathway which are to be integrated using ode45 in Ras.m
Rascycle.m and FRas.m are the functions being called by Ras.m
alon4_7.py simulates a C1-FFL network given by Alon when X receives a step input.
alon4_8.py simulates a C1-FFL network given by Alon when the step input to X is removed.
alon4_8c.py simulates the difference in Z level upon a short and large input pulse for X.
incoherent_ffd.py simulates various networks in Fig1 using boolean rules in Table 2.
integral_control.py simulates various networks in Figure6 using boolean rules in Table 2
